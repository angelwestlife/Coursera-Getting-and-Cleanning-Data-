activity_labels.txt: Labels and IDs for each of the 6 activities.

X_train.txt: 7352 observations of the 561 features, as the training data.

subject_train.txt: 7352 obs, contains subject ID for the training set.

y_train.txt:  7352 obs, activity ID

X_test.txt: 2947 observations, 561 features

3. Data prosessiont Steps:
a. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
b. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
c. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
d. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
e. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
